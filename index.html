              an exclusive campground completely surrounded by extraordinary
              wilderness such as Paynes Prairie and Newnan's Lake, and many
              trails to explore along the nearby Gainesville-Hawthorne State
              Bike Trail.
            </p>

                üå± <strong>Note:</strong> All campers must be self-contained,
                and only RV camping is available as Kate's Fish Camp does not
                offer sewage hookups because of the surrounding land's
                recognized natural, ecological and cultural values. There is a
                Love's Travel Stops about 15 minutes away that offers RV septic
                services.
