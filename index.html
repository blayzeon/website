              Located at the cross roads of SR 20, Prairie Creek and The
              Gainesville Bike trail, Kates Fish Camp makes an ideal place for
              outdoor adventures, canoeing, boating, camping, biking, bird

            <p>
              Kate's Fish Camp is more than just a place to park your RV, it is
              an exclusive campground completely surrounded by extraordinary
              wilderness with many trails to explore. Our campground is directly
              connected to the Gainesville-Hawthorne State Bike Trail and has
              total access to Newnan's Lake. All of our sites are pull-through
              sites, and each comes with electricity (20, 30, and 50 amp),
              water, and Gigablast high-speed Wi-Fi.
            </p>

                <strong>Note:</strong> All campers must be self-contained, and
                only RV camping is available, although we offer a guest restroom
                and a shower for your use as Kate's Fish Camp does not offer
                sewage hookups because of the surrounding land's recognized
                natural, ecological and cultural values. There is a Love's
                Travel Stops about 15 minutes away that offers RV septic
                services.
